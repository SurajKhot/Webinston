<h2>What is web mashup ?</h2>

<p>A mash-up is a Web page or application that integrates complementary elements from two or more sources.</p>

<p>Mash-ups are often defined by the type of content that they aggregate. A content mash-up, for example, brings together various types of content for presentation through an interface. That content could include among other things text, data feeds, video and social updates. An enterprise mash-up typically combines internal corporate data and applications with externally sourced data, SaaS (software as a service) and Web content. Business mash-ups might also provide integration with the business computing environment, data governance, business intelligence (BI)/ business analytics (BA), more sophisticated programming tools and more stringent security measures.</p>

<p>Like blogs and social media, mash-ups became popular as part of the ongoing shift towards more a more interactive and participatory Web (Web 2.0) with its greater concentration of user-defined content and services. According to Aaron Boodman, quoted in BusinessWeek online, "The Web was originally designed to be mashed up. The technology is finally growing up and making it possible."</p>

<p>Mash-ups are often created by using a development approach called Ajax, although there are also applications that automate processes. The term mash-up originated in the music industry, where it referred to songs that were combined from two or more other songs.</p>

<h3>Features of web mashup</h3>

<p>In the world of Web 2.0 and BI 2.0, mashups that are interactive and dynamic are appreciated by business end users. Interactivity can come in the form of drill-down or drill-through capability, as well as in the ability to use the Web-based feature or solution as a dedicated desktop application. And, a mashup can be made dynamic through the use of Flash technology, for example, by enabling key performance indicators, graphs or charts to update dynamically when the page is opened or refreshed.</p>

<p>Business intelligence features that have an interactive feel and intuitive, browser-based navigation help spread BI to a wider and deeper range of business end users. This model, called pervasive BI, is defined by accessibility of reporting and analysis tools to non-technical end users across organizations. Although mashups and dashboards are not the only features conducive to pervasive BI, they are a great example of how by integrating familiar Web 2.0 capabilities into a BI solution help more end users have access to the data and information they need.</p>

<h3>Advantages of web mashup</h3>

<h4>Increase productivity:</h4>
    
    <p>"An enterprise mashup platform enables companies to reduce the amount of work they do in order to get data to business users so that they can make decisions." Such an approach shifts workloads from overburdened IT staffs to non-technical staffs -- without "custom IT development" or "cumbersome integration solutions."</p>

<h4>Increase innovation:</h4>

    <p>Because they're user-friendly and user-driven, both senior executives and line business staffs can explore new opportunities and solve problems in new ways. An enterprise mashup platform would contain a "library of all mashups to be built so that they are available to anyone who wants to leverage existing thinking without reinventing the wheel."</p>

<h4>Improve data security:</h4>
    
    <p>"Enterprise mashup platforms enable an organization to quickly leverage the value of existing data securely across widely disparate sources, bringing information into tailored user interfaces, portals or platforms." </p>
