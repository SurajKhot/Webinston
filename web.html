<h2>What is web design ?</h2>


<p>Everything about your website - including the content, the way it looks, and the way it works - is determined by the website design. Web design is a process of conceptualizing, planning, and building a collection of electronic files that determine the layout, colors, text styles, structure, graphics, images, and use of interactive features that deliver pages to your site visitors. Professional Web design helps to make your business appear credible online.</p>

<p>The degree of customization included in your website design will determine the speed and cost of getting your site up and running.</p>

<h3>Features of Web Design </h3>

<p>One of the elements of good web design is a lack of the elements that make bad web design. If you stay away from everything listed on the page about dorky web pages, you've probably got a pretty nice web site. In addition, keep these concepts in mind:</p>

<h4>Text</h4>
    <p>Background does not interrupt the text </p>
   <p> Text is big enough to read, but not too big </p>
    <p>The hierarchy of information is perfectly clear </p>
    <p>Columns of text are narrower than in a book to make reading easier on the screen </p>
      
<h4>Navigation</h4>
    <p>Navigation buttons and bars are easy to understand and use </p>
    <p>Navigation is consistent throughout web site </p>
    <p>Navigation buttons and bars provide the visitor with a clue as to where they are, what page of the site they are currently on </p>
    <p>Frames, if used, are not obtrusive </p>
    <p>A large site has an index or site map </p>
      
<h4>Links</h4>
   <p> Link colors coordinate with page colors </p>
   <p> Links are underlined so they are instantly clear to the visitor </p>
      
<h4>Graphics</h4>
    <p>Buttons are not big and dorky </p>
    <p>Every graphic has an alt label </p>
    <p>Every graphic link has a matching text link </p>
    <p>Graphics and backgrounds use browser-safe colors </p>
    <p>Animated graphics turn off by themselves </p>
      
<h4>General Design</h4>
   <p> Pages download quickly </p>
   <p> First page and home page fit into 800 x 600 pixel space </p>
   <p> All of the other pages have the immediate visual impact within 800 x 600 pixels </p>
   <p> Good use of graphic elements (photos, subheads, pull quotes) to break up large areas of text </p>
   <p> Every web page in the site looks like it belongs to the same site; there are repetitive elements that carry throughout the pages .</p>

<h3>Advantage of web design</h3>

<h4>1. Consistent brand identity</h4>

<p>Professional designers think about the big picture. They create a visual language for your brand that is consistent across different contexts. Your website, logo, business cards, and even your Twitter profile have to form a coherent whole. Brands that have a consistent visual language make a more memorable impression than those that look like five different side-businesses.</p>

<h4>2. More visitors who stay on the page</h4>

<p>You’re not looking for clicks. You’re looking for visitors who browse through your site and get to know who you are. Remember that most people will leave after one glimpse at your site. It takes something special to keep them intereste<p>d, let alone willing to buy your product or service.</p>

<h4>3. More customers</h4>

<p>Calls to action are the sign-up, buy now, and learn more parts of your site. Where they are on the web page, how they look, and what they say will determine how many more people decide to buy something from you.</p>

<h4>4. Distinction from competitors</h4>

<p>Good-enough websites just don’t cut it anymore. Within one industry, there are many sites that look the same. They say the right stuff, the design isn’t too offensive, but they don’t make the effort to speak up and say why they’re special. That doesn’t mean you have to pull out the sparkly graphics to get attention. Quality means distilling all of your unique selling points into one coherent visual message.</p>

<h4>5. Form, structure and purpose to content</h4>

<p>Content and design need to be perfectly aligned on your site. Most people will not put in the effort to understand what you are trying to say. Large blocks of small text, confusing navigation, and obscured calls to action will turn visitors away. Designers work with your content so that it’s clear and directs people to what you want them to do.</p>



<h4>6. Polished details</h4>

<p>The choice of fonts, spacing of text, and contrast are details that make a difference in the overall quality of your site. These kinds of nuances may not seem that important, but they affect how readable and functional the site is.</p>


<h4>7. Objective perspective</h4>

<p>You are the expert on your own business, but you are not an expert on web design. Sometimes there needs to be a compromise between what you want and what works for the web. Quality web design also comes from the experience of knowing how to translate ideas into web pages.</p>

<h4>8. Less spending down the road</h4>

<p>Businesses that try to get a “good deal” and buy into the promise of getting high-quality design services for a cheap price often end up paying more than they need to. Why? They realize that high quality really does cost money and pay for another designer to re-do their site.</p>

<h4>9. Reliable partnership</h4>

<p>Business owners and web designers have to work together to create a website. The process involves communication and compromise. If you are satisfied with the result, the web designer you worked with will be your go-to for changes and new additions.</p>

<h4>10. Room for development</h4>

<p>Quality design builds a solid foundation for the improvements you will want to make after the initial site is finished. Whether you want to add a new product or service, the site will already have a strong enough aesthetic that you don’t have to go back to square one.</p>
