<h2>Whats is SEO ?</h2>

<p>Search engine optimization is a methodology of strategies, techniques and tactics used to increase the amount of visitors to a website by obtaining a high-ranking placement in the search results page of a search engine (SERP) -- including Google, Bing, Yahoo and other search engines.</p>

<p>It is common practice for Internet users to not click through pages and pages of search results, so where a site ranks in a search is essential for directing more traffic toward the site. The higher a website naturally ranks in organic results of a search, the greater the chance that that site will be visited by a user.</p>

<p>Search Engine Optimisation or SEO is the simple activity of ensuring a website can be found in search engines for words and phrases relevant to what the site is offering. In many respects it's simply quality control for websites. Having said that, if there was ever an industry that was little understood by outsiders it's SEO.</p>


<p>Ask some SEO companies about SEO and they'll try and blind you with science and confuse you into thinking it's a black art. Say to some companies what is SEO and two hours later you'll be none the wiser.</p>

<h3>HOW SEO WORKS ?</h3>

<p>You might think of a search engine as a website you visit to type (or speak) a question into a box and Google, Yahoo!, Bing, or whatever search engine you're using magically replies with a long list of links to webpages that could potentially answer your question.</p>

<p>That's true. But have you ever stopped to consider what's behind those magical lists of links?</p>

<p>Here's how it works: Google (or any search engine you're using) has a crawler that goes out and gathers information about all the content they can find on the Internet. The crawlers bring all those 1s and 0s back to the search engine to build an index. That index is then fed through an algorithm that tries to match all that data with your query. </p>

 <h3>Search Engine consists of </h3>
  <h4>1. Web Crawling</h4>
 <h4>2. Indexing</h4>
 <h4>3. Ranking </h4>

<h3>Features of SEO</h3>

<h4>1. Link Building</h4>

<p>Does your SEO Service software give you the ability to track, log or create backlinks? Top quality SEO service tools can actually search and find sites for you based off keywords you provide it and in return produce a report of qualified websites to start back linking on.</p>

<p>Look for a tool that can manage your links and provide you with information of who’s linking to your site. Both of these metrics are very important when tracking your backlink efforts. </p>
<h4>2. Content Analysis</h4>

<p>Look for software that can analyze your on-page content and can check for broken links, duplicate content and keyword frequency. Having these tools to analyze on-page SEO for your small business will help keep your content clean and rich for search engines.</p>
<h4>3. Keyword Research</h4>

<p>One of the most important features a tool that provides SEO services for small business will include is a good keyword research and management function. Being able to research your industry keywords and apply them to blogs and website content while managing the use of them will make your keywording efforts that much easier.</p>

<h3>Advantage of SEO</h3>

<h4>Increased Traffic</h4> 

<p>Top positions on the search engine result pages receive a majority of the impressions and clicks, so ranking in these top positions can result in significant traffic increases for your website. SEO also focuses on creating informative and keyword relevant title tags and meta descriptions, which show up in the result pages. Having optimized tags and descriptions helps to increase click through rate, which also promotes increases in qualified web traffic.</p>

<h4>ROI</h4> 

<p>SEO provides trackable and quantifiable results, regardless of whether you are an ecommerce or non-ecommerce site so there are no qualms when it comes to ROI. SEO agencies are able to track nearly every aspect of their strategy, like increases in rankings, traffic and conversions. Comprehensive analytics also provide the ability to drill down at a granular level and see demographic information and other engagement metrics for individuals who have interacted with your website.</p><p> For Ecommerce sites, SEO agencies can see which paths users take in order to complete a sale, all the way down to which keyword they used to search for you prior to purchasing. For non-Ecommerce sites, you can attribute values to your lead conversions, like a 'contact us' form fill-out, and calculate the value of your SEO strategy that way.</p>

<h4>Cost effectiveness</h4>

<p>SEO is one of the most cost-effective marketing strategies because it targets users who are actively looking for your products and services online. SEO's inbound nature helps businesses save money as opposed to outbound strategies like cold-calling. While cold-calling can still be an effective strategy, the leads generated cost 61% more than leads generated by an inbound strategy like SEO. And since SEO also targets users who are actively searching for products and services like yours, the traffic resulting from SEO is more qualified than many other marketing strategies, resulting in cost-savings for companies.</p>

<h4>Increased site usability</h4> 

<p>In an effort to make your website easier to navigate for the search engines, SEO simultaneously helps to make your website more navigable for users as well. SEO consists of rearranging the site's architecture and links to make pages within the website easier to find and navigate. This not only makes it easier for search engines to crawl your site and find pages, but also makes it easier for users to find information on your website as well. </p>

<h4>Brand Awareness</h4>

<p>Since top position rankings result in significant impressions, having your website in these top positions on the result pages translates to more exposure for your website. Plus, being on the first page for your targeted keywords not only helps users to associate your brand with those keywords, but it instills trust, since companies on the first page are generally perceived to be more trustworthy. The more your pages and content rank in high positions in the search engines, the more chances you have for users to see your content and associate with your brand.</p>
