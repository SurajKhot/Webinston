<h2>What is Responsive Web Design ?</h2> 

<p>There are a lot of features of perfect responsive web design which are very helpful for everyone. 
    Some of the most common features of best responsive web design are mentioned below. </p>  
    
    
<p>The purpose of responsive design is to have one site, but with different elements that respond differently when viewed on devices of different sizes.</p>

<p>Let’s take a traditional “fixed” website.  When viewed on a desktop computer, for instance, the website might show  three columns. But when you view that same layout on a smaller tablet, it might force you to scroll horizontally, something users don’t like. Or elements might be hidden from view or look distorted.  The impact is also complicated by the fact that many tablets can be viewed either in portrait orientation, or turned sideways for landscape view.</p>

<p>On a tiny smartphone screen, websites can be even more challenging to see. Large images may “break” the layout. Sites can be slow to load on smartphones if they are graphics heavy.</p>

<p>However, if a site uses responsive design, the tablet version might automatically adjust to display just two columns. That way, the content is readable and easy to navigate. On a smartphone, the content might appear as a single column, perhaps stacked vertically.  Or possibly the  user would have the ability to swipe over to view other columns.  Images will resize instead of distorting the layout or getting cut off.</p>

 <h3>Why Responsive web design ?</h3>           
    
<h4>Less Effort</h4>

the best responsive web design in their method for the cell phone sites.    </p>
            
<h4>Statics</h4>
<p>If you are allowing users to use a phone friendly version of your website, then your stats are being split into two.  </p>
<p>If you want to get complete insight on the visitors on mobile, then you should make a segment named “mobile-only”   
and this is the feature which makes a Responsive website best.    </p>
            
<h4>User Friendly website</h4>

on the invention of technologies and daily a number of smartphones come to the market.</p><p> Therefore,   
if you have a best responsive web design, then people will the opportunity to visit your website which is very beneficial for your website. </p>

<p>This will help you to make many useful contributions for a best and user friendly website.    </p>
            
<h4>Search Engine Optimization (SEO)  </h4>  
<p>Day after day, the search engines are getting very smart and they know how to figure out the   
connection of mobile websites with the desktop ones. And search engines bring the responsive website on the top of their pages. </p>   
            
<h4>No Redirects </h4>   
<p>It is also one of the best benefits of best Responsive web designing that you will not have to  
worry about any redirects because it involves not user agent targeting.  So, it is a great thing   
if you are a little irresponsible for taking care of the targeted users and redirects.    </p>
            
<h4>Less Maintenance </h4>   
<p>By making different versions of your website for different devices, you are doing nothing but   
increasing the load of work. This is because you have to make changes in more than one website.   
But if your website is a responsive website then you have to maintain it only once. This is because   
there will be only one layout which works for all sort of devices. This will reduce your efforts and your work load.   </p> 
            
<h4>Free of Device-Alternating Issues  </h4>  
<p>A very serious problem in designing the website both for mobile and for the desktop is that the users used  
to share the URL of your website to others. And the people who used to copy the link in their address bar   
and open it are not always browsing through the same gadget through which the website was shared.   
This drawback can be effectively removed by the best responsive web design.    </p>
            
<h4>It’s Not About The Device Only  </h4>  
<p>Best Responsive web design is not just about the device. If you are opening a website on a huge screen,   
you do not always experience the full screen web browser window. But if you are opening a best responsive website,  
then you should not care about the screen size. Best responsive web design will never let you do the horrible horizontal scrolling </p>   
            
<h4>Media Display Issues  </h4>  
<p>Perfect responsive web design not only re-sizes the pictures and content, but it also works for the media like videos, moving text, etc. and fix them according to the size of device you have.    </p>
    
            <hr>
<h3>Advantage of responsive of web design</h3>

<h4>1. Super Flexible</h4>


<p>Responsive web design sites are fluid, meaning the content moves freely across all screen resolutions and all devices. Both the grids and the images are fluid. Just as a liquid spreads out or draws in to allow its content to fill an allotted space and retain its appearance, responsive web design’s fluidity achieves the same result with website content on a device screen.</p>

<h4>2. Excellent User Experience</h4>


<p>While, content is king and discover ability of content are foremost success metrics, it is the user experience that enables visitors to consume content on any website through the device of their choice and preference, anytime. Thus, responsive web design is about providing the optimal user experience irrespective of whether they use a desktop computer, a smartphone, a tablet or a smart-TV. Responsive web design accommodates the busy professional during the day and the wide-awake college student needing access to your site anytime. No scrolling or resizing is needed for any visitor to access your website from their favorite device.</p>

<h4>3. Cost Effective</h4>

<p>The advantages of having a single site that conforms to the need of all devices are significant when compared to having two separate websites. One website costs less than two, and the savings can be substantial. Sites designed solely for mobile device traffic don’t offer the advanced navigational techniques found in traditional websites, and they also require the user to maintain two separate web addresses for your site. This is inconvenient for most people and can cause them to check out the competition’s website. Responsive web design enhances SEO efforts by having all your visitors directed to a single site no matter what they prefer to use as a device.</p>

<h4>4. It is Recommended By Google</h4>

<p>With 67 percent search market share, when Google speaks, search marketers listen. Google states that responsive web design is its recommended mobile configuration, and even goes so far as to refer to responsive web design as the industry best practice.</p>

<p>This is because responsive design sites have one URL and the same HTML, regardless of device, which makes it easier and more efficient for Google to crawl, index, and organize content. Contrast this with a separate mobile site which has a different URL and different HTML than its desktop counterpart, requiring Google to crawl and index multiple versions of the same site.</p>

<p>Additionally, Google prefers responsive web design because content that lives on one website and one URL is much easier for users to share, interact with, and link to than content that lives on a separate mobile site. Take for example a mobile user who shares content from a mobile site with a friend on Facebook who then accesses that content using a desktop, which results in that user viewing a stripped down mobile site on their desktop. This creates a less than optimal user-experience, and because of the large emphasis Google is now placing on user-experience as a ranking factor, this is essential to take into account with regards to SEO.</p>


<h4>5. Very Easy to manage</h4>


<p>Having a separate desktop and mobile site requires having separate SEO campaigns. Managing one site and one SEO campaign is far easier than managing two sites and two SEO campaigns. This is a key advantage a responsive website has over a separate mobile site. That being said, there are benefits to having a mobile-specific SEO strategy, such as optimizing for keywords that are more likely to be searched when someone is on their smartphone. For example, someone performing a mobile search for a local restaurant may be more inclined to use the word “nearby” in their search query. However, a separate mobile site is not a requirement for a mobile SEO strategy, and there’s no reason why mobile-specific keywords can’t be incorporated into a responsive design site as well.</p>

<p>At the end it is your decision, whether you take it or not.</p>
